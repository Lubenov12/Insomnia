# GPU Optimization Testing Guide

## 🧪 **Testing the Optimized INSOMNIA Website**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to test the website's performance without GPU acceleration and verify that all optimizations are working correctly.

## 🎯 **Testing Objectives**

### **Primary Goals:**

- ✅ Verify smooth performance without GPU acceleration
- ✅ Confirm all animations work on CPU-only devices
- ✅ Test video playback without hardware acceleration
- ✅ Validate page transitions remain smooth
- ✅ Ensure product interactions are responsive

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Disable GPU Acceleration in Chrome/Edge:**

1. **Open Chrome/Edge** and navigate to `chrome://flags/`
2. **Search for GPU-related flags** and disable:
   - `#disable-gpu` - Disable GPU hardware acceleration
   - `#disable-gpu-rasterization` - Disable GPU rasterization
   - `#disable-accelerated-video-decode` - Disable hardware video decode
   - `#disable-accelerated-2d-canvas` - Disable 2D canvas acceleration
3. **Restart the browser** to apply changes

### **2. Alternative Testing Methods:**

#### **Firefox Testing:**

- Open `about:config`
- Set `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` to `false`
- Set `media.hardware-video-decoding.force-enabled` to `false`

#### **Mobile Testing:**

- Use Chrome DevTools device simulation
- Enable "Slow 3G" network throttling
- Disable hardware acceleration in mobile settings

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Page Navigation Performance**

#### **Steps:**

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click on different navigation links (Home, Clothes, Login, Register)
3. Use browser back/forward buttons
4. Test with slow network conditions

#### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ Page transitions appear immediately
- ✅ Loading animations are smooth (60fps)
- ✅ No stuttering or lag during navigation
- ✅ Progress bar fills up realistically
- ✅ Loading text animates smoothly

### **Test 2: Hero Video Performance**

#### **Steps:**

1. Load the homepage
2. Watch the hero video playback
3. Check background video opacity
4. Test video loading states

#### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ Video plays smoothly without hardware acceleration
- ✅ Background video has simple opacity (0.3)
- ✅ No blur filters or complex transforms
- ✅ Loading states appear quickly
- ✅ Fallback content shows if video fails

### **Test 3: Product Section Interactions**

#### **Steps:**

1. Scroll through product listings
2. Hover over product cards
3. Click on product links
4. Test infinite scroll functionality

#### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ Product cards respond immediately to hover
- ✅ Image opacity changes smoothly (no scale transforms)
- ✅ Simple overlay effects (no complex gradients)
- ✅ Smooth scrolling performance
- ✅ Loading skeletons animate lightly

### **Test 4: Animation Performance**

#### **Steps:**

1. Navigate between pages rapidly
2. Scroll quickly through content
3. Interact with buttons and links
4. Test on different screen sizes

#### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ All animations maintain 60fps
- ✅ No frame drops or stuttering
- ✅ Smooth opacity transitions
- ✅ Responsive on all devices
- ✅ No memory leaks or performance degradation

## 📊 **Performance Metrics to Monitor**

### **Browser DevTools Metrics:**

#### **Performance Tab:**

- **Frame Rate**: Should maintain 60fps
- **CPU Usage**: Should be reasonable (under 50%)
- **Memory Usage**: Should be stable (no leaks)
- **Network**: Should load quickly even on slow connections

#### **Console Monitoring:**

- Check for any error messages
- Monitor animation performance logs
- Verify no GPU-related warnings

### **Visual Quality Checks:**

#### **Animation Smoothness:**

- ✅ Page transitions are fluid
- ✅ Loading spinners rotate smoothly
- ✅ Hover effects respond immediately
- ✅ Text animations are crisp

#### **Visual Consistency:**

- ✅ Dark theme maintained
- ✅ Purple accents preserved
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ No visual artifacts or glitches

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: Animations Still Stuttering**

#### **Possible Causes:**

- GPU acceleration not fully disabled
- Heavy JavaScript operations
- Complex CSS still present

#### **Solutions:**

- Double-check GPU flags are disabled
- Clear browser cache and restart
- Check for any remaining heavy animations

### **Issue 2: Video Not Playing Smoothly**

#### **Possible Causes:**

- Video file too large
- Browser still using hardware acceleration
- Network throttling too aggressive

#### **Solutions:**

- Compress video file if needed
- Check video encoding settings
- Test with different network conditions

### **Issue 3: Page Transitions Lagging**

#### **Possible Causes:**

- Complex animations still present
- Heavy DOM operations
- Memory leaks

#### **Solutions:**

- Verify all heavy animations removed
- Check for memory leaks in DevTools
- Simplify any remaining complex transitions

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

### **Device Simulation:**

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Enable device simulation
3. Test on various device sizes
4. Enable "Slow 3G" network throttling

### **Expected Mobile Performance:**

- ✅ Smooth scrolling on touch devices
- ✅ Responsive animations
- ✅ Quick page loads
- ✅ Battery-friendly performance

## 🌐 **Cross-Browser Testing**

### **Test on Multiple Browsers:**

- ✅ **Chrome/Edge**: With GPU disabled
- ✅ **Firefox**: With hardware acceleration off
- ✅ **Safari**: On macOS (if available)
- ✅ **Mobile browsers**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox

### **Expected Results:**
