# Homepage Loading Fixes & Visual Consistency

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hero Video Loading Issues

- **Problem**: Video sometimes didn't load on first render, requiring manual refresh
- **Solution**:
  - Added multiple preloading strategies (video element + fetch)
  - Implemented retry mechanism with 3 attempts
  - Added better error handling and fallback UI
  - Improved video loading event listeners
  - Added preload link in layout.tsx
  - **NEW**: Added hydration-safe mounting checks
  - **NEW**: Added robust document ready state checks

### 2. Product Loading Issues

- **Problem**: Products from Supabase didn't load properly on initial page load
- **Solution**:
  - Added pre-fetching mechanism for products
  - Improved caching strategy with 5-minute cache duration
  - Added retry mechanism for failed loads
  - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Added proper loading states and skeleton loaders
  - **NEW**: Added hydration-safe mounting checks
  - **NEW**: Added robust document ready state checks

### 3. Hydration Issues (NEW)

- **Problem**: Components trying to access DOM/API before page is fully hydrated
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isMounted` state to prevent hydration mismatches
  - Added document ready state checks (`document.readyState === 'complete'`)
  - Added fallback loading states during hydration
  - Added proper cleanup and timing delays

### 4. Visual Consistency Issues (NEW)

- **Problem**: Pages had inconsistent styling and didn't match the homepage's dark theme
- **Solution**:
  - Applied consistent dark theme across all pages
  - Updated color scheme to match homepage (black, gray-900, purple accents)
  - Standardized button styles and form elements
  - Added consistent typography and spacing
  - Ensured footer appears on all pages

## Technical Improvements

### Video Loading Optimizations

1. **Multiple Preloading Strategies**:

   - Create video element for preloading

2. **Retry Mechanism**:

   - Initial load attempt
   - Retry after 2 seconds if not loaded
   - Final retry after 5 seconds
   - Fallback UI if all attempts fail

3. **Better Event Handling**:

   - `loadstart`, `progress`, `loadeddata`, `canplay`, `canplaythrough`, `error`
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners

4. **Hydration Safety**:
   - Wait for component to be fully mounted
   - Check document ready state before operations
   - Fallback loading UI during hydration

### Product Loading Optimizations

1. **Enhanced Caching**:

   - 5-minute cache duration
   - Cache validation and cleanup
   - Pre-fetching on component mount

2. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Detailed error messages
   - Retry mechanism for failed requests
   - User-friendly error display

3. **Better Loading States**:

   - Skeleton loaders during initial load
   - Proper loading indicators
   - Smooth transitions

4. **Hydration Safety**:
   - Wait for component to be fully mounted
   - Check document ready state before API calls
   - Fallback loading UI during hydration

### Visual Consistency Improvements

1. **Dark Theme Application**:

   - All pages now use black background (`bg-black`)
   - Consistent gray color palette (`gray-900`, `gray-800`, `gray-700`)
   - Purple accent colors (`purple-400`, `purple-600`, `purple-700`)

2. **Typography Consistency**:

   - Large, bold headings (`text-5xl md:text-7xl font-black`)
   - Consistent text colors (`text-white`, `text-gray-300`, `text-gray-400`)
   - Proper spacing and line heights

3. **Component Styling**:

   - Dark form inputs with purple focus states
   - Consistent button styles with hover effects
   - Dark cards with border styling
   - Purple glow effects and shadows

4. **Layout Structure**:
